        <h2>History:</h2>
        <p>The Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Indian state of West Bengal, boasts a captivating history deeply intertwined with its unique ecosystem. This vast mangrove forest, the largest in the world, has been inhabited by indigenous communities for generations, who have adapted their lifestyles to the challenges of living in this dynamic environment. During the colonial era, the Sundarbans were exploited for timber extraction, which led to its designation as a protected area to conserve its natural resources. The year 1984 marked a significant milestone when the Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognizing its ecological importance and the need for its long-term protection. This historical journey reflects the delicate balance between human interaction and the preservation of a remarkable natural treasure, home to diverse wildlife, including the iconic Bengal tiger, and a vital buffer against coastal erosion and storms.</p>
