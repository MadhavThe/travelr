    <h2>History:</h2>
        <p><strong>Chandela Dynasty:</strong> The temples were constructed during the rule of the Chandela dynasty, which was known for its patronage of the arts and culture. It's believed that there were originally around 85 temples in Khajuraho, but only about 25 have survived over the centuries.</p>
        <p><strong>Decline and Rediscovery:</strong> Over time, the temples fell into disuse and were gradually abandoned. They were hidden from the world by dense forests until they were rediscovered by British officer Captain T.S. Burt in the 19th century. Since then, efforts have been made to restore and preserve these magnificent structures.</p>

        <h2>Significance:</h2>
        <p><strong>Architectural and Artistic Marvel:</strong> The Khajuraho temples were built between the 9th and 11th centuries by the Chandela dynasty. They are celebrated for their remarkable architectural design, exquisite sculptures, and intricate carvings that adorn the temple walls. These sculptures depict various aspects of life, including love, dance, and spirituality.</p>
        <p><strong>Erotic Sculptures:</strong> While Khajuraho is often associated with its erotic sculptures, these represent just a small fraction of the overall art. The temples also feature sculptures and carvings showcasing daily life, gods and goddesses, animals, and more. The erotic art, however, is considered symbolic and is believed to represent the various facets of human emotions, desires, and the ultimate goal of transcendence.</p>
