        <h2>History:</h2>
        <p><strong>Chandela Dynasty:</strong> The temples were constructed during the rule of the Chandela dynasty, which was known for its patronage of the arts and culture. It's believed that there were originally around 85 temples in Khajuraho, but only about 25 have survived over the centuries.</p>
        <p><strong>Decline and Rediscovery:</strong> Over time, the temples fell into disuse and were gradually abandoned. They were hidden from the world by dense forests until they were rediscovered by British archaeologists in the 19th century. Since then, efforts have been made to restore and preserve these magnificent structures.</p>
