        <p><strong>Architectural Style:</strong> Renowned for its stunning Mughal architecture, the Taj Mahal features a symmetrical design, intricate white marble inlay work, and ornate calligraphy. The central structure is flanked by four minarets and stands in the middle of a vast Mughal garden with reflecting pools.</p>
        <p><strong>Symbol of Love:</strong> Often called the "Symbol of Love," the Taj Mahal is a testament to the enduring love Shah Jahan had for his wife. It's considered one of the most romantic buildings in the world and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983.</p>
