        <!-- History of Amritsar -->
        <h2>History:</h2>
        <p>Amritsar was founded in 1577 by Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru. He planned the city around the sacred pool of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), which serves as the spiritual and cultural heart of the city.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Ancient History:</strong> Before Amritsar's establishment as a city, the region where it is located was historically known as the fertile land of the Punjab region. The name "Amritsar" itself is derived from two Punjabi words, "Amrit" (meaning "nectar") and "Sar" (meaning "pool"). It refers to the sacred pool around which the city was built.</li>

            <li><strong>Foundation by Guru Ram Das:</strong> The city was founded in 1577 by Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru. Guru Ram Das excavated the sacred pool, which later became the central feature of the Golden Temple complex. The city was planned to be a place of spiritual significance and communal harmony.</li>

            <li><strong>Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib):</strong> The Harmandir Sahib, often referred to as the Golden Temple, is the most iconic and revered religious site in Amritsar. It was constructed in the 16th century by Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru. The temple's golden exterior gives it its distinctive appearance. It has since become the spiritual and cultural heart of the city.</li>

            <li><strong>Role in Sikh History:</strong> Amritsar has played a central role in Sikh history and the development of Sikhism as a religion. It served as a gathering place for Sikh pilgrims and a hub for Sikh religious and cultural activities.</li>

            <li><strong>British Colonial Era:</strong> During British colonial rule in India, Amritsar gained significance for its role in the Indian freedom struggle. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919, where British troops fired upon unarmed Indian civilians, is a tragic event etched in history and took place in Amritsar. This incident led to widespread outrage and became a turning point in India's struggle for independence.</li>

            <li><strong>Partition of India:</strong> Amritsar witnessed significant turmoil during the partition of India in 1947. The city became a major transit point for refugees moving between India and Pakistan, and it experienced the painful consequences of the partition, including communal violence and displacement.</li>

            <li><strong>Modern Amritsar:</strong> Today, Amritsar is a vibrant city with a mix of historical and modern elements. It remains a center of Sikh culture and spirituality, attracting pilgrims and tourists from around the world. The city has also seen economic development and growth in various sectors.</li>
