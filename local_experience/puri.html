        <h2>History of Puri:</h2>
        <p>Puri is a historic and culturally rich city located in the eastern Indian state of Odisha (formerly Orissa). It is renowned for its religious significance, particularly as the abode of Lord Jagannath, one of the most revered deities in Hinduism. The history of Puri is intertwined with its religious and cultural heritage, and it has a long and fascinating history that spans many centuries.</p>
<ol>
    <li>  <b>Ancient History</b></li>
   Puri's history can be traced back to ancient times. It is mentioned in various ancient texts, including the Puranas, which are sacred Hindu scriptures. The city has been a significant center for Hinduism for centuries. The temple of Lord Jagannath, a form of Lord Vishnu, is believed to have been originally built by King Indradyumna in the 12th century BCE. The temple has undergone several renovations and expansions over the years.

   <li><b>Maurya and Gupta Periods</b></li>
   During the Maurya and Gupta periods in ancient India, Puri was an important center for trade and culture. It was known for its maritime activities and trade relations with Southeast Asia.

   <li><b>Medieval Period</b></li>
       Puri came under the rule of various dynasties and empires over the centuries, including the Mauryas, Guptas, Kharavelas, and later, the Ganga Dynasty and the Kesari Dynasty. The Ganga Dynasty, in particular, made significant contributions to the development of Puri as a religious center.

       <li> <b>Ganga Dynasty</b></li>
   The Ganga Dynasty, which ruled parts of eastern India from the 12th to the 15th century, played a pivotal role in the history of Puri. King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, a Ganga Dynasty ruler, is credited with the construction of the current Jagannath Temple in the 12th century CE. The temple complex is one of the holiest sites in Hinduism and has drawn pilgrims from across India for centuries.

   <li> <b>The Arrival of Europeans</b></li>
   During the colonial period, Puri, like the rest of India, came under European influence. The British East India Company established control over the region in the 18th century.

   <li> <b>Independence and Post-Independence Period</b></li>
   Puri became a part of the Indian Union after India gained independence from British rule in 1947. It has since remained an important religious and cultural center, attracting millions of devotees and tourists every year.

<li><b>Modern Puri</b></li>
   Today, Puri is not only known for its religious significance but also for its beautiful beaches, art, music, and the famous Rath Yatra, a grand chariot procession of Lord Jagannath, which is celebrated with great pomp and devotion every year. The city has developed into a major tourist destination and continues to thrive as a center of spirituality and culture.</p>
